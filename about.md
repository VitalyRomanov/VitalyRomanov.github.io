# About

My name is Vitaly Romanov and currently I am a researcher at Innopolis University. A great deal of topics interest me: NLP, Electronics, Nature, People, life in general...

In this blog I try to keep record of some of my activities, primarily for my sake, but maybe someone will find some use of it as well. 

For more professional information refer to [CV](assets/20230314.CV.pdf).
