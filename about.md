# About

My name is Vitaly Romanov and currently I am a researcher at Innopolis University. A great deal of topics interest me: NLP, Electronics, Nature, People, life in general...

In this blog I try to keep record of some of my activities, primarily for my sake, but maybe someone will find some use of it as well. 

For more professional information refer to [CV]().

*[FLIP]: First-Last-Invert-Play. A coding technique to achieve performant page transition animations.
